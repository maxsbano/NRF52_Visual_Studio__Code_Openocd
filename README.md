# NRF52_Visual_Studio__Code_Openocd
A launch.json configuration file for using GDB over OpenOCD in Visual Studio Code

This is the launch.json configuration file for developer who don't have the official Nordic debugger...
I used the FTDI ft232h adapter in SWD mode to connect to the target.
Use the .bat file to test the connection to target.
